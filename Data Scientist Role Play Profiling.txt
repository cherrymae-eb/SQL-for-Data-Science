Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

	I chose Las Vegas as my city and Food as the category.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	
	Yes, the restaurant that has 4-5 star rating opens from 10:00-19:00 every Monday to Saturday whereas, the other restaurant that has a 2-3 star rating opens a bit earlier at 8:00 and closes at 22:00 every Monday to Sunday.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

	Yes. the restaurant with 4-5 stars has more reviews with a total of 30 compared to the other restaurant with 2-3 stars only has 6 reviews.         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

	No, because the two restaurants are located in different postal codes.

SQL code used for analysis:

--------------------------------------------------------

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
	The businesses that are open are averaging more star rating compared to businesses that are closed. Below is shown the average star rating for open businesses and closed businesses.

	Open: AVG(stars) = 3.67900943396
	Closed: AVG(stars) = 3.52039473684           
         
ii. Difference 2:
	The businesses the are open are averaging far more reviews compared to businesses that are closed. Below is shown the average reviews for open businesses and closed businesses.

	Open: AVG(review_count) = 31.7570754717
	Closed: AVG(review_count) = 23.1980263158        
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

--------------------------------------------
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)),
		AVG(review_count),
		SUM(review_count),
		AVG(stars),
		is_open
	FROM business
	GROUP BY is_open
--------------------------------------------

+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------+
| COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) | AVG(review_count) | SUM(review_count) |    AVG(stars) | is_open |
+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------+
|                1520 |     23.1980263158 |             35261 | 3.52039473684 |       0 |
|                8480 |     31.7570754717 |            269300 | 3.67900943396 |       1 |
+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------+
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

	I analyzes the name and location and how the reviews of the top rated business category compared to others.         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

	I need the name, city, review count, star rating, and category of the business for this analysis. I chose these data to determine which business category received the top rating and how does it compared to the reviews it received. I also added the name and city of the business to determine how it affects the reviews that the business category receives. As per the data shown, the top rated category is Arabian but, it does not receive the most reviews simply because it is only a restaurant in comparison to the category that received the most reviews which is a market.
